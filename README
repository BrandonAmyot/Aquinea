Aquinea is a procedurally generated underwater scene generator written in C++ using OpenGL.
Scenes contain a terrain generated from simplex noise, along with procedurally generated rocks, animated coral and seaweed.
The program uses the phong illumination model including directional lights, spotlights, and moving point lights (glowing fish).
The program uses a quaternion based camera and supports the interactive element of shooting harpoons by clicking the mouse.
